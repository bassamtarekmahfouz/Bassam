# Building a ResNet (Residual Network) from Scratch using PyTorch

Building a ResNet (Residual Network) from scratch using PyTorch involves defining the model architecture, writing the forward pass, and then training the model on a dataset. ResNet is a popular deep learning architecture that helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by using residual blocks.

# Steps to Build ResNet
Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries
Importing the required libraries is the first step. PyTorch and its submodules are essential for building the model, handling data, and performing various operations.



# Step 2: Define the Residual Block
The Residual Block is the building block of ResNet. It includes two convolutional layers with a skip connection that allows the input to bypass these layers and be added directly to the output.


# Step 3: Define the ResNet Model
Construct the ResNet model using the residual blocks. The model starts with an initial convolutional layer, followed by several layers of residual blocks, and ends with a fully connected layer.

# Step 4: Prepare the Data
Load and preprocess the dataset. Here, we use CIFAR-10 as an example dataset.

# Step 5: Train the Model
Define the loss function and optimizer. Train the model on the dataset.


# Step 6: Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.


# Summary
In this guide, we've built a simple ResNet-18 from scratch using PyTorch. We defined the residual blocks, constructed the ResNet model, prepared the data, trained the model, and evaluated its performance. You can further extend this example by using deeper ResNet variants like ResNet-34, ResNet-50, etc., or by applying this architecture to different datasets.
